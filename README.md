# Rusty DSA Adventures ðŸ¦€ðŸ’»  

### Description  
**Partly a study of data structures, partly a study of Rust, mostly a study in how to hit your head against a wall hard enough and often enough that you break through it.**  

### What to Expect  
Welcome to the **Rusty DSA Adventures**, where:  
- We explore the art of solving data structure problems with the most memory-safe compiler and the least memory-safe developer.  
- Every borrow checker error feels like an unsolicited life lesson from your strictest teacher.  
- Every solved problem is a hard-fought victory in the war against your own confusion.  

### Features  
- **Algorithms** that look deceptively simpleâ€”until lifetimes and ownership enter the chat.  
- **`unwrap()` abuse** so intense, it deserves its own intervention.  
- A heartfelt journey of **pain**, **perseverance**, and the occasional _"Oh, it works!"_ celebration.  

### Warnings  
- Expect the **borrow checker** to judge you harder than your last performance review.  
- Simple things like linked lists will feel like epic boss fights.  

### Why Rust?  
Because solving problems isnâ€™t enough; we also like to suffer while proving our love for safety, performance, and overly-complicated error messages.  

Strap in, fellow Rustacean, and join me in this beautifully painful adventure into data structures, algorithms, and why we all secretly enjoy the chaos. ðŸ¦€
