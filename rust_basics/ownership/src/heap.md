# Heap Memory

- Data of no known, fixed size belongs on the heap
- Allocating data on the heap will return a pointer(an address to location where data has been allocated).
- Allocating on the heap is slower than pushing to stack.
- Accessing data on the heap is also slower, as it has to be accessed using a pointer which points to an address.
