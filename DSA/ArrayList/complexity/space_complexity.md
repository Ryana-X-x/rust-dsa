# **Space complexity** 

### **Space Complexity is the amount of memory space that an algorithm or a problem takeds during the execution of that particular program**

> **If we want to compare standard alogorithms on the basis of space, then Auxilarry Space would be better critertion than Space Complexity**

 - Auxiliary memory refers to a type of computer storage also known as "secondary storage" or "external memory," which is used to store data that is not currently being actively accessed by the CPU, providing a larger storage capacity compared to the primary memory (RAM) but with slower access times
